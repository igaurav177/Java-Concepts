/** Points To remember making abstract class and method
 *  Abstract method : only declaration not implementation
 *  If we declare one abstract method in class so, that class always abstract 
 *   
 *   Abstract class : Partially implemented class we declare as abstract class like if any abstract method init
 *   For abstract classes we can't make object for that.
 *   
 *   Abstract class vs Abstract method 
 * 1. If class contain at least one abstract method so we make that class as abstract class
 * 2. Abstract class can contain zero abstract method in it.
 * 3. Child class is responsible to implement the abstract class abstract method implementation.
