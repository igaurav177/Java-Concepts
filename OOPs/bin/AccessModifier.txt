// Access Modifier (member Type -> variable and method level)
-> Public member :
	- global level 
	- we can access from any where within the class or outside the class
	- Even we declare the member as public we can't access that member if our class is not public outside package we can't access it.
	- We check first at class level 
	- recommended modifier for method is public
-> Default member:  
	-package level
	- Class is public but member of that class is default we can access inside the package 
	- Outside package we can't access

-> Private Member: 
	- class level
	- If we declare member as private we can access it outside the class.
	- Private is highly recommended for member variable declaration
	- recommended modifier for variable is private

-> Protected Member:
 	-> with in the current package anywhere we can access but outside the package only in child class.
 	-> + compulsory we have to use child class reference only to access the private member outside the package.
 	-> Protected --> default + child class.
 	
 	
 ->conclusion: 
	 private < default < protected < public
	 

-- -- Method Signature -- --
public int m1(int i)

-- method sign for above method : methodName(parameter types) 
 -- m1(int)
 
eg : public int m2(int i,float f)
 -- m2(int ,float)
